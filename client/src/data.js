            'A hip fracture is one of the most serious types of bone fractures, and it can happen in people both young and old. Teenagers are especially prone to pelvis fractures because their bodies are still growing. Hip injuries from playing sports or severe traumas, such as from car crashes, can cause fractures in the pelvis in teens. This can limit their ability to remain active and live a normal life, and will require advanced treatment.',
            'The elderly are also prone to hip fractures. Those with osteoporosis – an age-related loss of bone integrity – are especially prone to this type of fracture, which can occur by simply falling and landing awkwardly on their side.',
