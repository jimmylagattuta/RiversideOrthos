                    'What is an Independent Medical Evaluation?',
                    'An Independent Medical Evaluation (IME) is often required to answer specific medical questions, including relationships of diagnosis to specific injury, accident or illness, further treatment recommendations, extent of permanent impairment or disability, and other information as needed. Our practicing physician consultants possess a broad range of credentials, and board certifications in their respective specialties. We make every effort to schedule and complete the IME as soon as possible. After completion, we process and send a comprehensive report within a 24 hour period.',
                    'We provide emergency surgery and treatment for the most serious work-related injuries and facilitate treatment including occupational therapy and physical therapy for common conditions such as tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, knee pain, and back pain.',
                    'We also offer comprehensive physical and occupational therapy as well as new state of the art non-surgical treatment including Platelet Rich Plasma injections.',
                    'Midland Orthopedic Associates strive to ensure expeditious scheduling of appointments for injured workers, typically within twenty-four hours. Our physician forms and reports are available within one business day, with quick reports available the day of service. We will complete any employer work status forms at the time of visit.',
                    'Any necessary diagnostic tests will be arranged by our office staff, and we will take care of any required Workers Compensation authorization procedures. We work closely with nurse case managers and will provide any necessary documentation to the injured worker at the time of visit.',
